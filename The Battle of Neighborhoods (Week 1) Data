Data

To help Jeronimo in his search we will need to access following data:

- The Localities of Bogotá, Colombia from Wikipedia: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Localidades_de_Bogot%C3%A1

- The coordinates (latitude, longitude) ot these Localities of Bogotá from Open Street Map APIs

- From Foursquare we will need following venues data:
  - the burger joint venues of the Localities
  - the offices venues of the neighborhoods
  - the high schools venues of the neighborhoods
  - the universities venues of the neighborhoods

We will then leverage the data in order to determine which locality is the most appropiate in order to locate the burger joint.
